# The Role of Science Communication in My Work

Science communication has been at the core of my career, bridging the gap between research, policy, and public understanding. My goal has always been to make complex scientific insights more accessible and actionable, whether through direct engagement with policymakers, public writing, or training other scientists in effective communication. Below, I outline the key aspects of my science communication journey, from media outreach to workshops and invited talks.

## Science Communication Experience

### Science Communication Liaison
During my time at the **National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)** and **COMPASS Science Communication**, I worked closely with researchers to refine their messaging and communicate their findings in meaningful ways. My role involved:
- Training and coaching NCEAS research teams on science communication strategies.
- Helping develop a science-policy program at COMPASS, ensuring that cutting-edge research informed regional policy solutions along the West Coast.
- Bridging gaps between scientific research and public engagement, focusing on making environmental insights more actionable.

## Bringing Science to the Public: Writing for Mass Media
Beyond academic circles, I have engaged in public science communication by writing mass media articles. These pieces aimed to translate complex scientific issues into accessible narratives for broad audiences.

## Using Visual Narratives: Graphical Abstracts
I have also used **graphical abstracts** to communicate research findings in an engaging and concise format. These serve as visual summaries that make scientific concepts more digestible for online audiences.
