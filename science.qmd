# My Approach to Science

My scientific approach is driven by **curiosity** and a **slow, careful weaving of data and analyses** to answer highly complex questions. I believe that solving these challenges requires an **interdisciplinary mindset**, integrating diverse perspectives to uncover deeper insights into natural systems.

## Research Themes

### Carbon Fluxes in Source-to-Sink Systems

#### What Are Source-to-Sink Systems?
Source-to-sink systems describe the **movement of carbon from its point of origin (source) to its ultimate storage location (sink)**. These systems are crucial for **climate regulation** as they determine how much carbon is released into the atmosphere versus how much is sequestered in long-term reservoirs such as soils, sediments, and aquatic environments. Understanding these pathways helps to reveal the resilience of landscapes in regulating global carbon cycles.

#### Carbon Storage and Release in Headwater Systems
My doctoral research investigated the **dual role of headwater systems** in the Oregon Cascades as both carbon storage and release compartments. This work explored how headwater environments mediate carbon transport, controlling the balance between long-term sequestration and short-term fluxes into downstream systems.

#### Dynamics of Organic Carbon Transport
Another key focus was on the **dynamics of organic carbon particles traveling from headwaters to river mouths**. By tracking particulate organic carbon (POC) movement, I analyzed how different factors—such as hydrological events and sediment interactions—affect carbon fluxes across watershed scales.

#### Millennial-Scale Organic Carbon Export and Burial
I also examined **millennial-scale organic carbon export and burial** in the Oregon Coast Range, highlighting the role of geomorphic processes in determining carbon sequestration potential. This study provided insights into how long-term landscape evolution influences the efficiency of carbon burial in sedimentary basins.

### Carbon Dynamics Across the Landscape: the DBGCR Hypothesis
Building upon this foundation, I am currently developing the **Dynamic Bio-Geomorphic Fabric for Carbon Redistribution (DBGCR) hypothesis**. This hypothesis reframes the role of forests in the Oregon Coast Range, proposing that they function as **dynamic climatic buffers** rather than static carbon sinks or sources. It suggests that:

  - Carbon redistribution is regulated by landscape feedback mechanisms rather than a simple input-output system.
  - Disturbance regimes play a pivotal role in priming landscapes for efficient carbon burial.
  - The interplay between vegetation, hydrology, and geomorphic processes defines long-term carbon storage potential.

### From Variability to Information Theory
Through my research, I recognized that **changes in variability** contain essential signals of natural history. This realization led me to apply **information theory** as a tool to analyze how natural systems encode and evolve over time. This perspective has guided my broader work on:
- The **role of uncertainty and entropy** in ecological and geomorphic transitions.
- The **Generalized Entropic Uncertainty Principle (GEUP)**, which explores the nonlinear evolution of uncertainty in complex systems.
