It turns out that all that litter not only affects water quality but also is important to maintain earth’s climate.\nAs a communicator, I build infrastructure for happier and courageous research: people-first, likable, reliable, and “gettable” products, and acknowledging differences in position, power, and privilege across multiple platforms.\nTake a look around and help yourself!\nHere is My Curriculum, TL:DR?\nHere is My Resume"
