It turns out that all that litter not only affects water quality but also is important to maintain earth’s climate.\nAs a communicator, I build infrastructure for happier and courageous research: centered on people, likable, reliable, and “gettable” products, and acknowledging differences in position, power, and privilege across multiple platforms.\nTake a look around and help yourself!\nHere is my curriculum\nToo long; didn’t read?\nHere is my resume\n\n\n\nguerrero.francisco.jose@gmail.com"
