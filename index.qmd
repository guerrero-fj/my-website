::: {#bio}
Hi there! I'm Francisco Guerrero (my last name is pronounced "ge-*as in get*, rhe-*as in recipe*, and roh-*as in roman*"). I'm an environmental scientist and water resources specialist with 20+ years of **bridging research, policy, and strategic communication** to tackle complex water and environmental challenges. I'm amazed by the extraordinary role that the interaction between **rivers and forests** in tropical and temperate mountains play in regulating **earth's climate**. I currently work for the Oregon Water Resources Department where I provide technical support for **multimillion** programs and projects that protect water through strategic planning, policy analysis, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Outside of work, I'm an **avid movie watcher**, dog-lover, and a devoted husband. Poke around to learn more [about me](about.qmd) and my work!
