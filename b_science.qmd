# Resilience in Source to Sink Systems

## What are Source to Sink Systems or S2SS?

"It's sedimentary my dear Watson" -Sherrock Holmes

Source to sink systems are part of our everyday life. Imagine how your energy levels change from the moment you get up in the morning until you go to bed at the end of the day.

Hello!

I am a researcher and a science communicator. I care about water and people.

As a researcher, I study what happens to leaves and twigs that fall into rivers and streams. It turns out that all that litter not only affects water quality but also is important to maintain earth's climate.

As a communicator, I build infrastructure for **happier and courageous** research: centered on *people*,  likable, reliable, and "gettable" *products*, and acknowledging differences in position, power, and privilege across multiple *platforms*.

Take a look around and help yourself!

## What happens to Particulate Organic Carbon when it moves down the river?

## What does sunk Particulate Organic Carbon tell us about watershed resilience to multiple disturbances?
